## Problem-1 
developing a mobile app for a car navigation system that helps drivers find the nearest gas station while traveling on a long highway. 
The highway is represented as a straight line, and the locations of gas stations along the highway are known and stored in ascending order of distance from the starting point. 
### The task is: 
implement a function that takes a list of gas station locations and the current position of the car as input . The function should return the index of the nearest gas station to the car's position. 

### Example 
###########locations=[10,20,30,40,50,60] 
###########carPosition=35
